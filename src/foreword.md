# Foreword

Solidity is a strongly-typed and object-oriented based language. However when it comes to solidity the ecosystem is more than just the nuts and bolts of the language. Due to it's usage being primarily in blockchain based financial systems it would be irresponsible to introduce the language without also pontificating on the basic financial structures (primitives) that are so commonly used in the space.
Due to the repercussions of the misuse of the language precedent plays a huge role in the knowledge a solidity programmer must have.
In writing this 'Solidity-Book' we hope to provide a foundation not only for language syntax but also a syllabary of an entirely separate financial paradigm.
